 Similar to the Empire State Building, the architecture style used here is Art Deco, which was a very popular style in the 1930s. It was designed by William Van Alen and made with a steel frame. This building has 3862 windows on the outside of the building. One big part of the Art Deco style is the horizontal black and white stripes between floors. There are a lot of radiator caps with wings. One unique thing about the Chrysler Building has a terraced crown. It has geometric decorations which adds to its style

 The Chrysler Building is known for its design and is often called the epitome of the Art Deco skyscraper. The building also has a theme of the sun and particularly the sunburst pattern on the crown. Many movies were actually filmed at the Chrysler Building
