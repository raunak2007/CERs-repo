## RECS Flights Group Project

A group project for AP Computer Science Principals, [hosted here](https://raunak2007.github.io/RECS-repo/). It is a collection of four features related to travel, one created by each group member. The main emphasis of this project is to learn about databases and APIs; [the backend is also on github](https://github.com/EdwinKuttappi/farmersflask), but may go down when the school AWS server is not running.

### [Destinations around the world - Colin Weis's feature](https://raunak2007.github.io/RECS-repo/famousdestinations.html)

You can upload a title and text to the database. Everytime the page is reset the post (and like count) are read from the API. Next, the frontend uses JavaScript and JQuery to create each post in HTML. You may click the like/dislike buttons to change the like cpint and the flag to remove a post from the database.

### [See Maps of your Trip - Edwin Abraham's feature](https://raunak2007.github.io/RECS-repo/maps)

You can input a set of coordinates and then the API will take the values and then show you a map of your location. These inputs will also be put inside of the database and then read from the API, and the frontend uses JavaScript and JQuery to add to the database.
